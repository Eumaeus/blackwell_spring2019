## Attendance policy:

A freshman who exceeds 15% of the class meetings or an upperclassman who exceeds 25% for any reason will be in violation of the maximum established by the University (p. 40 of the Furman University Catalog) and will be dropped from the course with a grade of “F.”

## Academic integrity:

Academic Integrity standards are important to our Furman community and will be upheld in this class.  Students should review the Academic Integrity Pledge posted in the classroom and resources available on <www.furman.edu/integrity>.  In this class, the grade penalty for an academic integrity violation is a reduction in grade in proportion to the gravity of the offense.
 
Additional resources in the Center for Academic Success (CAS; LIB 002):
The Writing & Media Lab (WML) is staffed by student Consultants who are trained to help you improve your writing and multimodal communication skills.  The consultation process is non-directive and intended to allow students to maintain ownership of their work.  In addition to helping with the nuts and bolts, WML Consultants also support you in developing your own ideas thoughtfully and critically, whether you’re writing an essay or planning a video or other multimedia project.  You may drop into the WML during its regular hours (LIB 002; 9 AM to 10 PM) or visit the Writing and Media Lab website to make an appointment online.
 
Professional Academic Assistance Staff in CAS can provide students assistance with time management, study skills, and organizational skills.
