(Newer assignment appear at the top)

- For **Friday, March 14**: Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UHt0Nau3CQ) on Greek participles. It is a focused on NT Greek, but applicable across all ancient Greek. Also, you can go ahead and save [this text file](texts/Luke2_for_alignment.txt) to your computer, and set up [Ugarit](http://ugarit.ialigner.com/index.php). Go ahead and bookmark [this page](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0155%3Abook%3DLuke%3Achapter%3D2) so you can easily look up forms. **Hint**, when you go to [the page with the text file](texts/Luke2_for_alignment.txt), click on the "Raw" button before copying! 
- For **Monday, March 11**: For the Monday after Spring Break, complete an alignment of your chosen passage. Be prepared for a *short written test*, in class, in which you answer some questions about your passage and its language. Be prepared to stand up before the class and give a short presentation on any four of the following words or phrases from your translation. This can be what the words mean (in a rich sense, from the Lexicon), morphology, how the grammar works, or how, perhaps, the words fit with the meter of the poem. **Fighting** ἁμαρτῇ, ἐκ χειρῶν, αὐχένα μέσσον, ἦλθʼ, νὺξ ἐκάλυψε, βεβλήκειν, ἄμυνεν, ἀντίθεον Σαρπηδόνα, δῖοι ἑταῖροι, οὔ τις, τοῖον γὰρ ἔχον πόνον. **Andromache** παρίστατο, δάκρυ χέουσα, ἔπος τʼ ἔφατʼ, ἐλεαίρεις, ἔσομαι, εἴη, οὐ … ἄλλη ἔσται, οὐδέ μοι ἔστι πατὴρ καὶ πότνια μήτηρ, ἀπέκτανε δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς, Θήβην ὑψίπυλον, ἔκτανεν, ἐπὶ σῆμʼ ἔχεεν, νύμφαι ὀρεστιάδες κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο. **Dining** ἐπεπείθεθʼ, ἔθηκʼ, ἔχεν Αὐτομέδων, τάμνεν δʼ ἄρα δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς, Μενοιτιάδης … ἰσόθεος, Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο, νόησε δὲ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς, πλησάμενος δʼ οἴνοιο δέπας.
